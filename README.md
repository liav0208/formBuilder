# FormBuilder

### This web application is made for creating dynamic form ,share them and let people fill them.

### In this web app i use those packages:

- forntend:
  - Vue.js 3
  - vue-router
  - @meforma/vue-toaster
- backend:
  - Node.js
  - express
  - mongoose
  - cors
- Database
  - MongoDB

After you clone the project, make sure you in the **server** folder in your command line,
and run the command `npm run project`.
this command will set the database, run the server and run the Vue application.

In order to set the database i use the command `mongorestore`.
in case you dont have **MongoDB Database Tools** it may not work,
but the database files stored in directory in the main folder named **formBuilderDB**
